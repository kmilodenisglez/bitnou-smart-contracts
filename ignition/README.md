# Hardhat Ignition

This directory is reserved for Hardhat Ignition deployment modules.
Each module should export an array of Ignition steps that describe the desired contract deployment process (e.g., deploying `BitnouCoin`, configuring `BNOUPool`, etc.).

Currently there are no Ignition modules in this repo, but you can create one when you're ready by following the Hardhat Ignition documentation: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-ignition/docs/deployment-modules
